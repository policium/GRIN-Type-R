## 1. Preliminary preparation

## Determine the array
For GRIN Type-R, you can choose a combination of ANSI, ISO, JIS layout, single space bar and split space bar. Since the number of switches and keycaps required for each of them varies, it is necessary to decide in advance.

## 3. Initial Operation Check

Remove the board from the bag1.
The shipped board has the ANSI version of PRK Firmware already written on it. This is the first step in confirming that it works properly.  

### Connect the board to the PC and make sure it is recognized.

Connect the board to the PC with a USB cable. Connect the board to the PC with a USB cable and make sure the drive "PRKFirmware" is recognized.  

### Connect the board to the PC with a USB cable.

Short-circuit the two points in the picture with tweezers or other conductors, and check that "1" is input. If it does not, please send us a message from the mail icon at the top of the Booth store website.

The key layout is set to ANSI in the shipping state.  

## 4. Soldering the diode

Attach the diodes from the bag2 to the board.  

Attention!  
Depending on the key layout and the way the switch is installed, there may be positions where the diode does not need to be installed.  
Do not install the diodes in unnecessary positions as they may interfere with the stabilizer.  
Refer to the layout image in red for the required diodes.

Caution!  
Some diodes are oriented differently from others. Please look at the silk carefully and mount them correctly.  

Bend the legs of the diode.  
![IMG_20211024_185426__01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3132296/138599397-515d71bd-303b-48e0-98fb-fd6c56f75fc6.jpg)

Align the direction of the silk with the direction of the diode and set it.  
![IMG_20211024_185451__01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3132296/138599443-0b524bb9-5166-402d-975e-d0db50a08e34.jpg)

Fix the diode with masking tape.  
![IMG_20211024_185700__01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3132296/138599491-e0bae086-d260-48b1-b428-10e3a5f24a5f.jpg)

Turn it over and solder it.  
![IMG_20211024_185829__01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3132296/138599533-31aaaf06-3e98-4a53-ac3d-a49286c5c794.jpg)

Cut off the legs with nippers and clean up the surrounding area with a flux cleaner.  
![IMG_20211024_190343__01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3132296/138599571-aa82a8cc-f0f4-4994-95de-8e2329e0151e.jpg)

## 5. Solder the PCB socket for the switch

If you want to mount the switch directly, skip this step.

Place the socket and solder it. Solder the socket while holding it with tweezers to prevent it from floating.  
![IMG_20211024_191023__01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3132296/138601716-b302675a-c47f-4df0-85e3-4094c506b9ff.jpg)

The orientation shown in the picture below is wrong.  
![IMG_20211024_190934__01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3132296/138602574-db98be8a-e68b-4710-9918-185e2c19d15a.jpg)

## 6. Installing the stabilizer

Install the 2U stabilizer for backspace, shift key, enter key and ISO enter of 2U or larger size.  
![img_20211024_201044__01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3132296/138602682-9a904d91-1ccc-49bf-b053-58f890d8d942.jpg)

Install the 3U wire stabilizer for the 3U space bar.  

## 7. Screw in the switch plate and the board.

Screw the switch plate to the board in three places with the bag3 screws and spacers.  
![img_20211025_012308](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3132296/138603250-d2de6202-2906-4cfb-a936-b46ea861370a.jpg)

![img_20211024_202016__01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3132296/138603264-aa535f03-cefc-45b1-8bed-a865e45260f8.jpg)

## 8. Installing the switch

In the case of a socket, stick the switch into the socket, taking care not to bend the switch terminals.  
For direct mounting, solder the switch from the back. When soldering, be careful not to let the switch float.  
![IMG_20211024_204917__01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3132296/138603407-edfcd077-62f7-4b1f-a821-9fadd0bea6f5.jpg)

## 9. Attach the top plate and the board

Attach the screws and spacer lengths from the bag4 to the top plate in eight places.  
![img_20211024_211905__01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3132296/138603512-0a3e8f68-802c-4a07-bf53-0dec95cf8f33.jpg)

Stick the bag5's plastic washers into the spacers one by one. Next, stick the bag5's rubber washers into the spacer one at a time.  
Caution!  
The hard one is the plastic washer and the soft one is the rubber washer.  
![IMG_20211024_211924__01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3132296/138603569-339cebf9-9d9b-4629-9fc4-827d561a5353.jpg)

Stick the switch plate screwed to the board into the spacer.  
![IMG_20211024_212044__01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3132296/138603678-1e5cce81-fcb9-41f5-9264-fee6a1c8ebae.jpg)

Stick "2" rubber washers from the bag5 onto each spacer. Next, stick the thick spacer from the bag4.  
![IMG_20211024_212158__01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3132296/138603821-a8e88bc6-4702-40da-89e2-c6be5727c03e.jpg)  
If the surface of the spacer is not flush, check the number of spacers and the float.  

## 10. Attach the feet to the bottom plate.

Attach the aluminum feet and rubber feet from the bag6 to the bottom plate.  
Attach the aluminum feet to the bottom plate with M4 screws.
The red circle is the position for attaching the rubber feet.  
![FEET layout](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3132296/146915719-ce421d2b-c62c-4877-b785-19031218be0e.jpg)

## 11. Attaching the bottom plate

Screw the bottom plate to the main unit in 8 places with the screws of bag4.

## 12. Attaching the key cap

Attach the key cap to the switch.

## 13. Operation check

Connect to a PC with a USB cable and check the operation. If necessary, modify the source code to correct the key layout.  
Please refer to [sample](https://github.com/policium/grin-type-r/tree/main/firmware) for modification.

## 14. 3D printed case

While logged in to BOOTH, access the relevant order details from your purchase history and download the 3D data.  
You can print it at [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/), [WENEXT](https://www.wenext.com/), or [DMM.make](https://make.dmm.com/print/). HP MJF PA12 Nylon is recommended. HP MJF PA12 Nylon is recommended. 
Of course, you can also print it with your own 3D printer at home.  

Note!  
This 3D data is not supported. You are free to use the 3D data including modification, but please refrain from redistributing the data including derivatives.  

Cover the top plate with the snap fit (claws).
Connect the case to the pillar with a 2mm band to keep it from coming off.  

![case snap](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3132296/146917573-4bb67aa8-68a3-4ec0-9f66-ae6a32ada06e.jpg)

You can also paint it for fun!

## A1. appendix

For troubleshooting and firmware modification.  

### Disable USB storage in KMK Firmware. ã€€

Rewrite boot.py with the following: USB storage will no longer be recognized when the USB is plugged and unplugged and reconnected.  
Caution! If you modify it carelessly, you will need to recover from REPL or reinstall the firmware.  

```
boot.py
The following example uses the
import storage
import supervisor

storage.disable_usb_drive()
supervisor.set_next_stack_limit(4096 + 4096)
```

### Re-enable USB storage. ã€€

[MU Editor download](https://codewith.mu/en/download)  
Install it.  

Connect the GRIN Type-R to the PC.  
Start the Mu Editor.  
Click the Serial button from the tool bar.  
![mu1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3132296/139570715-863a8d0e-bd0e-4078-bd58-74653904e181.png)

Click the REPL pane and press "Ctrl+C".  
![mu2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3132296/139570725-34043950-0abd-4ff3-8fd7-a7b0392efc4c.png)

Press "Enter".  
![mu3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3132296/139570730-8251d9de-786d-4ed5-adbd-70f82e0f3e97.png)

Copy and paste the following code directly. (Don't type it in manually)  
````
import os
import storage
storage.remove('/', readonly=False)
os.remove('boot.py')
```!

![mu4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3132296/139570737-318f5c8b-f691-4309-be04-386b7738ed17.png)

If you plug and unplug the USB of the GRIN Type-R and reconnect it, it will be recognized as a USB drive.  
Since boot.py is missing from the drive, create boot.py with the following code.  

boot.py
The following code will create boot.py
import supervisor

supervisor.set_next_stack_limit(4096 + 4096)
```
